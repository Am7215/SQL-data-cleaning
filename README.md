This repository contains a project that demonstrates various data cleaning techniques using SQL. The project covers removing duplicate values, handling null values, standardizing data formats, and removing unnecessary columns to ensure the dataset's integrity and quality. Each cleaning technique is implemented as a separate SQL script, making it easy to apply these techniques to your datasets.
